# USA-Housing-price-prediction
here is popular usa housing dataset
our task is to predict house price on the basis of features

#Features
1.Avg. Area Income
2.Avg. Area House Age
3.Avg. Area Number of Rooms
4.Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms
5.Area Population
6.Address


These features have numeric data so we are going to use LINEAR REGRESSION and KN REgressor
and compare both which one perform better

steps
1.import libraries
2.load data
3.data preprocessing
4.EDA
5.Model building
6.model evalutions

conclusion
LINEAR REGRESSION
R-square-: 0.9176785596254428
RMSE-:102973.29737544905

KN Regressor
R-square-:0.580146029657495
RMSE-:232550.49682708966
